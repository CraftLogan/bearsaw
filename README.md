Bearsaw works with [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/) and [calebporzio/bear-sync](https://github.com/calebporzio/bear-sync) under the hood in order to create posts for your jigsaw based blog.

Please notice that you will only be able to create posts for the basic blog-starter brought you by jigsaw.<br>
Feel free to contribute if you would like to see your ideas coming along with this tool.
